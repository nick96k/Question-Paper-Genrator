# Question-Paper-Genrator

Developed a web app using JSP and Servlets for automatic question paper generation, with JDBC for database operations. It had separate sections for admins and teachers.

Admins managed teacher accounts, including adding, viewing, and deleting them.
Teachers registered through a dedicated page and added questions by units. Marks were auto-assigned based on keywords like
"what," "how," and "explain".

The application provided teachers with the capability to generate both unit-wise (30 marks) and whole-subject (75 marks)
question papers automatically, streamlining the question paper creation process
